            <p>The coronavirus pandemic has made life difficult for the poorest population in the world as the economic
                crisis triggered by it has led to a sharp rise in income inequality. The report, titled ‘The Inequality
                Virus’, indicated how the pandemic made the rich even richer, while the poor population suffered.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, over 1.70 lakh people lost jobs every hour during the month o April 2020, according to
                the report. The Centre For Monitoring Economic Research, a Mumbai-based think tank, has often pointed
                out that the employment outlook is not improving even as the country’s economy recovers.</p>

            <p>During the initial months of the pandemic, most of the job losses were from the informal sector, which is
                still struggling. The Oxfam report suggested that 75 per cent or over 9 crore of 12.2 josh lost due to
                the pandemic were from the informal sector, where income levels are already low.</p>

            <p>Not just jobs and income, but inequalities have also increased in other areas such as healthcare and
                education during the pandemic.</p>

            <p>Access to education for India’s poorest population has reduced with online education replacing physical
                classes. The report noted that just three per cent of the poorest 20 per cent of Indian households had
                access to a computer, while just nine per cent had access to an internet connection.
            </p>
            <p>The Oxfam report also noted that 6 per cent of the poorest 20 per cent households had access to
                non-shared
                sources of improved sanitation, compared to 93 per cent of the top 20 per cent households in the
                country.
            </p>
            <p> “The spread of disease was swift among poor communities, often living in crammed areas with poor
                sanitation
                and using shared common facilities such as toilets and water points,” it said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Experts have already said that the Covid-19 pandemic has caused permanent damage to the country’s poorer
                population and only higher spending by the government can help them recover.
